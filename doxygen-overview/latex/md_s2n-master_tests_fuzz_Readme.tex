\#\+Fuzz Tests Every test in this directory will be run as a Fuzz test for several minutes during builds. To run all fuzz tests simply run {\ttfamily make fuzz} from the top {\ttfamily s2n} directory to compile s2n with the proper flags and run the fuzz tests.

\paragraph*{Each Fuzz Test should conform to the following rules\+:}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item End in either {\ttfamily $\ast$\+\_\+test.c} or {\ttfamily $\ast$\+\_\+negative\+\_\+test.c}.
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item If the test ends with {\ttfamily $\ast$\+\_\+test.c}, it is expected to pass fuzzing and return 0 (hereafter referred to as a \char`\"{}\+Positive test\char`\"{})
\item If the test ends with {\ttfamily $\ast$\+\_\+negative\+\_\+test.c} the test is expected to fail in some way or return a non-\/zero integer (hereafter referred to as a \char`\"{}\+Negative test\char`\"{}).
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Strive to be deterministic (Eg. shouldn\textquotesingle{}t depend on the time or on the output of a R\+NG). Each test should either always pass if a Positive Test, or always fail if a Negative Test.
\item If a Positive Fuzz test, it should have a non-\/empty corpus directory with inputs that have a relatively high branch coverage.
\item Have a function {\ttfamily int \hyperlink{s2n__server__fuzz__test_8c_aea409319c7706f2cf28137757e2c36d4}{L\+L\+V\+M\+Fuzzer\+Test\+One\+Input(const uint8\+\_\+t $\ast$buf, size\+\_\+t len)}} that will pass {\ttfamily buf} to one of s2n\textquotesingle{}s A\+PI\textquotesingle{}s
\item Optionally, if initialization is required, have a function {\ttfamily int \hyperlink{s2n__server__fuzz__test_8c_ab4d51e660cd18e9b881a804ba252d9d7}{L\+L\+V\+M\+Fuzzer\+Initialize(const uint8\+\_\+t $\ast$buf, size\+\_\+t len)}} that will perform any initialization that will be run only once at startup.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\subsection*{Fuzz Test Directory Structure}

For a test with name {\ttfamily \$\+T\+E\+S\+T\+\_\+\+N\+A\+ME}, its files should be layed out with the following structure\+:

{\bfseries Required\+:} The actual Fuzz test to run\+: \begin{quote}
{\ttfamily s2n/tests/fuzz/\$\{T\+E\+S\+T\+\_\+\+N\+A\+ME\}.c} \end{quote}


{\bfseries Required\+:} The Corpus directory with inputs that provide good branch coverage\+: \begin{quote}
{\ttfamily s2n/tests/fuzz/corpus/\$\{T\+E\+S\+T\+\_\+\+N\+A\+ME\}/$\ast$} \end{quote}


{\bfseries Optional\+:} Any {\ttfamily L\+D\+\_\+\+P\+R\+E\+L\+O\+AD} function overrides\+: \begin{quote}
{\ttfamily s2n/tests/fuzz/\+L\+D\+\_\+\+P\+R\+E\+L\+O\+A\+D/\$\{T\+E\+S\+T\+\_\+\+N\+A\+ME\}\+\_\+overrides.\+c} \end{quote}


\#\+Corpus A Corpus is a directory of \char`\"{}interesting\char`\"{} inputs that result in a good branch/code coverage. These inputs will be permuted in random ways and checked to see if this permutation results in greater branch coverage or in a failure (Segfault, Memory Leak, Buffer Overflow, Non-\/zero return code, etc). If the permutation results in greater branch coverage, then it will be added to the Corpus directory. If a Memory leak or a Crash is detected, that file will {\bfseries not} be added to the corpus for that test, and will instead be written to the current directory ({\ttfamily s2n/tests/fuzz/crash-\/$\ast$} or {\ttfamily s2n/tests/fuzz/leak-\/$\ast$}). These files will be automatically deleted for any Negative Fuzz tests that are expected to crash or leak memory so as to not clutter the directory.

\#\+L\+D\+\_\+\+P\+R\+E\+L\+O\+AD The {\ttfamily L\+D\+\_\+\+P\+R\+E\+L\+O\+AD} directory contains function overrides for each Fuzz test that will be used {\bfseries instead} of the original functions defined elsewhere. These function overrides will only be used during fuzz tests, and will not effect the rest of the s2n codebase when not fuzzing. Using {\ttfamily L\+D\+\_\+\+P\+R\+E\+L\+O\+AD} instead of C Preprocessor {\ttfamily \#ifdef}\textquotesingle{}s is preferable in the following ways\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Using the C Preprocessor requires the use of fuzz only compiler flags and {\ttfamily \#ifdef}\textquotesingle{}s that end up cluttering the original s2n codebase and increases developer cognative load when developing other features for s2n. Using {\ttfamily L\+D\+\_\+\+P\+R\+E\+L\+O\+AD} helps keep s2n\textquotesingle{}s code clean, and reduces developer cognative load when working with the core codebase.
\item {\ttfamily L\+D\+\_\+\+P\+R\+E\+L\+O\+AD} provides better flexibility than {\ttfamily \#ifdef}\textquotesingle{}s in that it allows different Fuzz tests to efficiently have different function overrides for the same functions.
\item It is possible to override functions that are outside of s2n\textquotesingle{}s codebase.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Each Fuzz test will have up to two {\ttfamily L\+D\+\_\+\+P\+R\+E\+L\+O\+AD} function override files used\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item A test specific {\ttfamily \$\{T\+E\+S\+T\+\_\+\+N\+A\+ME\}\+\_\+overrides.\+c} file that contains overrides specific to that test.
\item {\ttfamily global\+\_\+overrides.\+c} file that contains overrides that will be used in every fuzz test.
