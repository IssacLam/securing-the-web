Software verification is critical to ensuring the overall safety of complex systems in different industries. Examples include bounded model checking used in securing aircraft control systems, nuclear reactor controllers and medical systems. With regard to the network infrastructure of these sophisticated systems, the respective implementation of the TLS/SSL protocols is crucial as it is responsible for the privacy and maintenance of data integrity of the entire network communication. In light of the Heartbleed problem, Amazon designed a lightweight implementation of the TLS/SSL protocols known as s2n, with security and reviewability in mind. This dissertation aims to verify the memory safety of the s2n implementation by using CBMC.

The research problems for this project are to investigate whether there are any hidden bugs in a heavily-tested critical software package (s2n)  and the capability of a bounded model checker, CBMC, to detect these hidden bugs. In this project, we demonstrate a possible way to verify an industrial software package as well as show the memory safety of its implementation and the over-approximation techniques to scale up the verification. From the experimental results, we found two arithmetic overflow bugs that exist in the s2n implementation and the respective solution has been reported to and accepted by Amazon's s2n developers.
