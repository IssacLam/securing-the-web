security relative bugs.

gammar check
make a friend read it out loud

2.5.1
why does this matter. make it clear. OK ssl matter and s2n is a thing.
talk about tls/ssl

traffic run on HTTPs
SSL is the thing to make the web secure. e.g. financial usage
SSLv3
what is tls.
why do we care.
openssl is used % traffic

because of this concern Amazon deside the rewrite it and make sure it is correct and safety
tls/ssl use for whole range of communtation
encrypted transport layer
Therefore, if there is a ssl bug. here is the impact.

s2n represent a critical piece of web server infrastructure.

I taken a proof tool and find a real bug in the critical piece.
s2n spent a lot of money.
I still finding bugs.

chapter 3
Hypothesis
Investigate is the question.
Is it possible to use CBMC to find bugs in critical infrastucture
Overall * experiment to show CBMC is a effiency bugs in critical infrastucture.
a way of showing memory safety

Hypothesis.
method have to be able to produce evidence.
from evidence can make argument.
is supported.


3.1 system
what system is s2n verision?

what bit of code.

clear about the system and clear about the spec

we using cbmc to look for these kind of things in s2n

3.2 spec
when we say bugs 
These properties I am going to check, and why? why its matter
meaning and 

3.3 why picking CBMC (optional)
How we gonna use it

3.4 Here is the way, I am donig it
Bottom-up module-based approach + graph

Chapter 4
we talked about approached here are result.

put p option on the table
